Installation.

Download the pstoedit sources.
Add drvminara.c and drvminara.h to the pstoedit/src directory.
Add the following line to the specific_drivers_src section
of pstoedit/src/makefile.am:
	drvminara.cpp drvminara.h			\
Run automake and then .configure && make && make install .

If anyone knows how to make dynamically loadable pstoedit drivers, let me know...
